<p>2025 is here, and most of us plan to read more books when the new year comes. There are thousands of books to read, but if you’re wondering which books are worth reading to change your life, come along with me because I will list the top 5 books you should read in 2025 that will change your life.</p>

<p><strong>Quick disclaimer:</strong> These books may sound cliché because you have seen them everywhere, but trust me, if you haven’t read them yet, give them a try.</p>

<p>This one is different because it challenges the modern self-help industry’s focus on the positive, arguing that the key to a fulfilling life is not about having everything you want but about focusing on what matters.</p>
