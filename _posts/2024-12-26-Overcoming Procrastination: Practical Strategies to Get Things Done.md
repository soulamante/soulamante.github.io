Have you ever found yourself scrolling through social media while you have to work? We all have.   
I have been procrastinating on writing an article about digital detox, so I was inspired to research procrastination.   
Here is what I found out.  
Procrastination is deferring or postponing a task until the last minute. It can severely reduce productivity.

Some people are chronic procrastinators, meaning they have problems finishing a task on time; others are situational procrastinators who delay work until the last minute.

People also divide procrastinators into different groups.

- **Perfectionists** - delay tasks because they fear not completing the tasks perfectly.  
- **Dreamers** - have big dreams about things but take little to no action on them.  
- **Overdoers:** - These people do a lot of work and struggle to find the time to do it all.  
- **Worrier** - They put off work because they fear the unknown and get anxious quickly.  
- **Defier** - these people are rebellions and don't like doing the expected tasks.  
- **Crises-maker** - these people like the pressure of last-minute work, so they wait until the last minute.

Procrastination happens to the best of us, and you don't have to beat yourself up for procrastinating, but you can follow a few techniques to tackle tasks without procrastinating too much.

#### Understanding procrastination
We delay tasks despite knowing the negative consequences, so what are the most common reasons people procrastinate?  

- **Perfectionism** — People delay submitting their work or start doing it for fear of it being not good enough.  
- **Low self-esteem** — People who don't believe in themselves to do a task procrastinate.  
- **Fear of success** — Some people fear success and its pressure, so they procrastinate.  
- **Fear of failure** — To avoid potential criticism, people delay doing what they should do.  
- **Cognitive biases** — Overstimating future capacity to complete a task or underestimating its complexity leads to procrastination often.

#### Consequences of procrastination

Not doing the work we are supposed to do has many consequences, but we often must think about those consequences while procrastinating.  
We may emotionally feel stressed, excited, or guilty for not doing the things we were supposed to do.  
We must meet deadlines to ensure productivity, but procrastination often damages our work, business, or studies.  
While procrastinating, we miss many life opportunities, which might strain our relationship.

#### How to overcome procrastination?

After having a decent knowledge of procrastination, it's good to take action to beat it, but it takes time.  
It's a journey. You don't have to be so hard on yourself. Instead, it would be best to start light and easy, one step at a time. 

With that being said, here are some steps to help you overcome procrastination:  

- **Break down tasks** — It's easy to procrastinate when we have a big project, so breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks and starting with the easiest one helps overcome procrastination.

- **The two-minute rule:** — If a task takes two minutes or less, start doing it. You can also incorporate the above method into this one.  
Eliminate distraction—It's easy to procrastinate while your phone is in front of you, so try to minimize the amount of distraction you have.  
- **Time blocking method:** — Go to your calendar and block time to focus on a single task only. It's easy to procrastinate when we have too much on the table.  
- **Let go of perfectionism.** — Admit that you can't be perfect; no one is. All you have to do is finish the work; you don't have to be perfect.

### Conclusion

We all procrastinate by delaying tasks from their intended deadlines for various reasons, but ultimately, we can overcome procrastination by using the different techniques we discussed.  
Stop waiting for motivation to kick in and start doing something today. Motivation and action are not linear. Sometimes, motion leads to action, and other times, action leads to motivation, which leads to action.
