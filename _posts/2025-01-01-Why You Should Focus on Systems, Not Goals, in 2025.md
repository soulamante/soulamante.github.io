As the new year approaches, many people are eager to set goals for themselves. We get hyped for the first few months; however, when the new year fades, the initial enthusiasm goes away.   
By the end of the year, many New Year resolutions are abandoned, leaving a sense of disappointment.  
The common focus on goals during the new year left the most important thing unseen: the importance of systems.  

Instead of focusing solely on goals, it's essential to shift our focus to systems that can increase the likelihood of success in the long term.  

This article aims to delve into the compelling reasons why systems are more effective than goals and how you can implement them to transform your life in 2025.

### Defining Goals vs. Systems
A Goal is a specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) outcome you aim to achieve in a defined time frame.   
For example, losing a certain amount of weight or completing a project in a specific amount of time are goals.   
Goals provide a sense of direction and might even push you forward in the short term.  
A System, on the other hand, is a process-oriented approach that focuses on the routines, habits, and processes that enable progress toward your desired outcome.   
It's a series of steps that you consistently take over time in order to achieve your goals.  
For example, Following a specific workout routine or adopting a daily journalling habit are systems.  
Goals and Systems are different concepts that contribute to success in various ways. Here is a breakdown of their characteristics.  

|            | Goals                                   | Systems                                                           |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Focus**  | Desired outcome.                        | Process and Habits.                                               |
| **Nature** | Static, Fixed target.                   | Dynamic and Adaptable.                                            |
| **Time-frame** | Specific deadline.                  | Continuous and Ongoing.                                           |
| **Motivation** | External achievement.               | Internal growth and Improvement.                                  |
| **Mindset** | "I will be happy when I reach my goals." | Enjoy the present moment and improve simultaneously.              |
| **Example** | Lose 20 pounds in 3 months.            | Implementing a daily exercise routine and meal planning strategy. |


Goals provide a sense of direction and motivate you to achieve something specific. However, they lead you to focus on the result rather than the journey.  
On the other hand, systems make you focus on continuous improvement, action, and long-term growth.  

Here are some real-life examples of goals vs systems so you can better understand them.

***Goal*** - Write a book  
***System*** - Follow a writing schedule, for example, writing one daily page.  
***Goal*** - Become a professional athlete.    
***System*** - Create a training schedule that includes strength training, skill development, and recovery protocols.  
You get the idea.  
Instead of concentrating on the goals, concentrate on the systems. This means forgetting about the outcome and focusing more on the process.

Remember that the goal is what you want to achieve, and the system is how you get there. By building a solid system, you can set yourself up for success in any area of your life.  
Systems are more effective than goals because they offer a sustainable and adaptable framework for growth, resilience, and progress.

Goals can create pressure and lead to stress or burnout, while systems can alleviate some of that pressure, enabling you to stay focused on your daily efforts.  
There is a good case study about the British cycling team in the book Atomic Habit that goes like this:

> In the early 2000s, British Cycling was struggling. They had only won one gold medal at the Olympic Games in the previous 100 years.
Then, Dave Brailsford took over as performance director in 2003.   
Instead of setting a goal to win a certain number of medals, Brailsford focused on creating a continuous improvement system.  
He called it "the aggregation of marginal gains," which meant making 1 percent improvements in everything they did.
This included:
- Redesigning the bike seats to make them more comfortable
- Testing different fabrics in the wind tunnel to reduce drag
- Having riders wash their hands with antibacterial gel to avoid illnesses
These changes may have seemed insignificant on their own, but they had a huge impact when added together.  
Within a few years, British Cycling was dominating the sport. They won seven of ten gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and repeated their dominance in 2012 in London.

This success demonstrates that focusing on the process and making small, continuous improvements can produce remarkable results.   
So here are practical examples for implementing systems in 2025.

1. **Habit stacking.**  
Habit stacking is a technique for building a new habit by linking it to an existing one.   
This makes the new habit more prominent and easier to remember. For example, if you want to start stretching every morning, you could stack it on top of your existing habit of brushing your teeth. Your habit stack would be:  
   _"After I brush my teeth, I will stretch for 15 minutes."_  
To make a habit of stacking more effective, consider the following:
- Make cue specific and immediately actionable; instead of _"When I take a break for lunch,"_ try _"When I close my laptop for lunch."_  
- Start with small habits and gradually increase the complexity or duration as you become more comfortable.

2. **Implementation Intention.**  
Implementation intention is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. It helps fill the gap between your intention and action.  
The basic format is: _"When situation X arises, I will perform response Y."_  
To use this strategy, fill out this sentence: _I will **[BEHAVIOR]** at **[TIME]** in **[LOCATION]**._  
For example, _I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. at my local gym._  

This method works because you're more likely to take action when you have clarity and a predetermined plan by making the time and location of your desired action so obvious.

3. **Environmental Design.**  
Your environment can significantly impact your behavior. By designing your environment, you can make a good habit easier and a bad habit harder.  
Here are some examples:  
   - _Make the cues of good habits visible:_ If you want to read more, place a book on your bed, so it's the first thing you see when you sleep.
   - _Reduce exposure to cues that trigger bad habits:_ If you're trying to lose weight, keep unhealthy snacks out of sight.

4. **Habit Tracking.**  
Habit tracking is a simple yet powerful way to stay motivated and accountable.   
You can see how far you have come and identify areas where you need to improve your tracking habits.    
You can use a habit tracker app, spreadsheet, or notebook.

5. **Reflection and Review.**  
Regular reflection and review are essential for ensuring that your systems are working.   
Consider scheduling a time each week or month to review your progress and make adjustments if needed.  
You might ask yourself the following questions when reviewing:  
- What's working well?
- What could be improved
- What changes can you make?

Remember, systems are meant to be dynamic and adaptable. By focusing on them, you can transform your life in 2025.   
_This article is based on the book Atomic Habit by James Clear._   
I highly recommend you read it, especially if you're trying to build a habit.
