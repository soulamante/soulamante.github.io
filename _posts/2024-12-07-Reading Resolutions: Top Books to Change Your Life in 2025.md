### Introduction

2025 is here, and most of us plan to read more books when the new year comes. There are thousands of books to read, but if you're wondering which books are worth reading to change your life, come along with me because I will list the top 5 books you should read in 2025 that will change your life.

**Quick disclaimer:** These books may sound clichÃ© because you have seen them everywhere, but trust me, if you haven't read them yet, give them a try.

#### 1. Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams by Matthew Walker

Matthew Walker is no ordinary man. He is a sleep scientist who has studied how sleep affects our physical and mental well-being.

This book will help you understand why we sleep, how sleep affects our daily lives, and, more importantly, how to optimize sleep.

#### 2. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life by Mark Manson

This one is different because it challenges the modern self-help industry's focus on the positive, arguing that the key to a fulfilling life is not about having everything you want but about focusing on what matters.

It offers a great perspective on prioritizing what matters most and accepting our limitations.

This book suits those who want a more honest and no-nonsense approach to life.

Mark also has a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@IAmMarkManson) channel with over 2.5 Million subscribers where he talks about a lot of no-nonsense self-help advice.

#### 3. Building a Second Brain: A Proven Method to Organize Your Digital Life and Unlock Your Creative Potential by Tiago Forte

This book introduces a new concept called "second brain," a method for capturing, organizing, and leveraging your information to increase productivity and mental clarity.

It discusses digital tools and techniques to create a personalized productivity system.

If you're overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information in your digital life, this book provides practical strategies for better organizations. It's especially useful for knowledge workers, students, and anyone looking to get more out of their digital tools.

Tiago also has a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@TiagoForte) video in which he talks about similar things about productivity and interviews people who read his book and created their own "Second brain." I highly recommend checking it out.

#### 4. Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl

In this book, Viktor shares his experience as a Holocaust survivor and his philosophy of finding meaning in all forms of suffering. He explores the concept of existentialism and how to live a life filled with purpose through his narrative and psychological insight.

This book is a deep psychological read that can help readers better understand their own lives and the meaning of suffering.
