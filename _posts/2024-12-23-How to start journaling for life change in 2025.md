I have always been a massive fan of writing for personal use. For that reason, I have been journaling since I was 16.  
Initially, I didn't know what to write about, but eventually, when I kept writing, it changed my life.   
So, I am presenting you with a 30-day challenge to try journalling and see how it changes your life.  
If you're wondering how keeping a journal might benefit you, here are some that may help you:
### Benefits of Journalling.
1. **Makes you boost your mood.**  
	If you're feeling down or having a rough day, try writing it down. Don't think about what you write; it doesn't have to be the next great novel; write down your feelings.  
    Without realizing it'll lift your mood.
2. **Helps you improve your communication skill**  
	When you write, you turn your abstract ideas into something tangible. It helps you understand yourself and communicate with others.  
	You'll also have clarity and insight about yourself, making it easier to express yourself at any time.
3. **Helps you sleep better.**  
	If you let out all your worries and thoughts before you sleep, you'll get much better sleep than ever.  
	Researchers believe that letting out all the disturbing thoughts before you go to sleep helps you sleep better at night.
4. **Helps you learn from your mistakes**  
	As humans, we're constantly making choices, and those choices sometimes end up being mistakes. Making mistakes is good because it helps us grow, but repeating the same error frustrates us.   
    Writing in a journal will help you identify and be aware of those mistakes next time.
5. **Understand yourself better.**  
	One of the most beneficial things journalling can do is help you better understand yourself.   
    It enables you to keep track of everything in your life, making you better understand yourself.

These are just the tip of the iceberg. Once you incorporate journalling into your life, you'll see many benefits.    
If you're starting journaling or want some tips on how to keep one, keep reading. I have some for you.

### Simple steps to start journaling
1. **Choose a medium to write**  
	Everyone has a preference here. Choose what suits you best: a traditional notebook or a digital app.   
    Just choose one and experiment with it.
2. **Find a comfortable space**  
	It's time to talk to yourself, so you don't need anyone to bother you. It is your me time.   
    Choosing a quiet and comfortable place will help you to think deeply and write clearly.
3. **Create a routine**  
Establishing a routine can greatly enhance your mental health while journaling.   
It's beneficial to have a consistent routine, whether it's in the early morning or at night.
4. **Be authentic**   
	It is your private space; no one will see and judge you, so be true to your writing.   
    Don't worry about your grammar, the length of your entries, spelling, or writing style.   
    What matters is that you've stayed true to yourself.

### Tips on journaling
Here are some tips to help you in your journaling.
1. **Review your day**  
	You can review your day while you journal. Ask yourself questions about how your day went out, what went as planned, what didn't go well, what did you achieve, etc.  
	I do this every day, and it helps me understand what's working and what's not.
2. **Mood journaling**  
	Not everyone is good at talking about their feelings, so keeping a mood journal helps us express our thoughts and emotions without anyone judging us.
3. **Wish lists and bucket lists.**  
	What do you wish to have? What have you always wanted to do?   
    Keeping a list of those things will help you understand whether you're living the life you want to live.
4. **Write your goals.**  
	Substantial research suggests that writing down goals has a significantly more significant effect than not writing them down.  
	These studies collectively suggest that writing down goals enhances clarity, motivation, and accountability, making them more likely to be achieved.  
	Write down your goals to have a better chance of achieving them.
5. **Write a letter from your future self**  
	It will help you understand what you want to become in the future.
6. **Explore different journalling style**  
	Experiment with different types of journaling to find what best suits your needs.   
    Different styles can offer new perspectives and benefits, Whether bullet journaling, stream of consciousness, or structured reflective writing.
